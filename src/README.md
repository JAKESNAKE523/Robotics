#How to setup development
1. Setup folder structure like so:
    /main_folder
        /build
            THIS IS WHERE YOU CLONE THE REPO INTO
        /src
            SHOULD BE EMPTY TO START
2. Clone the repo into the build directory

3. Move gulpfile.js into the main folder

4. Run 'gulp updateSource'

5. Start development (Only push to git with gulp; the necessary commands should be set up; for commit message use the flag -m and supply message as an argument)

 - Use gulp run(or just gulp) to watch files for changes
 - Use gulp build to build
